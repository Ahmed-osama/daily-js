    #v8
        - u can use it to write js inside c++ code
        - shell.cc : 
            shell
            shell - print_code
    
    #bigwords
    
        machineCode: is what computer process speak, all code is compiled(converted) into machine code
            we don't write machine code because its hard for humans
            maxhine code > assembly > C/C++ > javascript
        
        ecmascript:  is the standred javascript was based on, we needed a standered since there is many 
            javascript engine, 
        
        javascript Engine : a programme that converts javascript code into something the computer can
            process & understand

        v8: google open source javascript engine, follows ecmascript standered, its written in c++


    #aside
        - processors: micro processor seaks a language, we give it instructions, and it understands it
            some speak [iA-32, x86-64, ARM, MIPS], 
        - machine code: 
        - C++ : 
        - node is written in C++, its a c++ programme, v8 the engine is written in c++
        - **.cc file is c++ file
